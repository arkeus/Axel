	 * AxGroup is the basic container object. When building a world, you'll often want to group objects
	 * together for more manageable code. With AxGroup, you can add any AxEntity into it, including other
	 * AxGroups, allowing you to create a hierarchy of objects. AxGroup is a simple group that will call
	 * draw separately for each object added. If you have a large number of static objects, you should
	 * consider using AxTilemap, AxMap, or AxCloud, as those will perform better. However, each of those
	 * have their own limitations.
	 * 
	 * <p>AxGroup is also perfect for grouping up objects for collision. In this case, if you are not adding
	 * them to your state, this is the best kind of group to use. However, if you add an object to multiple
	 * groups, only one of those groups should be added to your state, otherwise the object will be updated
	 * and drawn multiple times, causing unpredictable results.</p>
