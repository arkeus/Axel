Axel is a free AS3 game framework for building flash games. It uses stage3d rendering to provide extremely fast rendering that is easily portable to phones and tablets. For full information and documentation, check out the [official website](http://axel.io).

About
-----
Axel is an **as3 library** that makes **flash game development** as easy as possible. Axel takes advantage of Flash Player 11's **Stage3D** in order to offload all the rendering to the GPU in order to gain huge performance boosts over the typical flash display list. As of Adobe Air 3.2, Stage3D is also supported when building your games for **mobile devices**. This means exporting your flash games to iOS and Android has never been easier!

Axel is completely free, so download it and start making games today! Axel is released under the MIT license, so you don't have to worry about being restricted about what you can do with your games!

Getting Started
---------------
Axel assumes you have a basic understanding of as3 and how to build your files. If you've never used as3 before, you'll want to follow some guides online. You'll also want to familiarize yourself with an IDE. I recommend [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) if you're looking for something free, or [Flash Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/flash-builder.html) for something a bit more powerful but not free.

Once you've got yourself set up, the [tutorials](http://axel.io/tutorials.php) will get you familiarized with setting up Axel to work with your IDE, and will also provide you with guides to making a basic platformer. From there you may want to read through the [full api documentation](http://axel.io/docs/) to learn the ins and outs of all the features available to you. Reading through the commented code is also a fanstatic way to not only learn about the API, but also learn how things work on the inside. You can also check out some [open source demos](http://axel.io/demo.php) to show you examples how to build different kinds of games.
